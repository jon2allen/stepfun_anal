Okay, the user asks for a table of poets from "300 Poems of Tang Dynasty" with specific details in Markdown format. Let me start by recalling the structure of that anthology. It's a classic collection, so the poets are mostly well-known Tang-era figures. Need to list each poet's name in Chinese characters, pinyin, English name, lifespan, and the number of poems included.

First, I should confirm the exact poets in the book. The anthology includes 77 poets across different periods. Wait, does the user mean the entire collection or a specific edition? Since it's a standard reference, I'll assume the commonly accepted list. Let me mentally scan through major poets like Li Bai, Du Fu, Wang Wei, etc. Some poets have multiple entries, but the user wants the count per poet, not per poem.

Next, verify lifespans. Tang Dynasty spans 618-907 CE, so poets' birth and death years must fall within or near that. For example, Li Bai (701-762), Du Fu (712-770). Need to be precise with years, especially for less famous poets. Maybe cross-reference with historical records to avoid errors.

Then, the number of poems each contributes. The total is 300, so the sum of all counts must equal 300. I recall Li Bai has the most, around 30-40? Wait, let me think: Li Bai has 33, Du Fu 39? Actually, I should check reliable sources. Since I can't look it up now, I'll rely on memory: Du Fu has 39, Li Bai 33, Wang Wei 29, etc. But need to ensure the total adds up.

Also, some poets might have disputed authorship or multiple names. For example, "Wang Changling" vs. "Wang Jian"? Better stick to the standard names in the anthology. The user specified "from the book," so it's the poets included, not all Tang poets.

Markdown format means a table with headers: Chinese Name, Pinyin, English, Lifespan, Number of Poems. Need to align columns properly. Use pipes and ensure no missing data. Double-check counts: if a poet has 1 poem, it's listed; if none, they wouldn't be in the book. So all entries should have at least one.

Wait, are there any poets with the same English name but different Chinese? Unlikely, but pinyin might have tone marks? Usually, pinyin without tones is fine. English names are standard transliterations.

Finally, sort the table? The user didn't specify order. Probably alphabetical by English name or by number of poems. Since it's a reference, maybe by number descending to show prominent poets first. But the user didn't ask for sorting, so I'll list as per common references, maybe by dynasty period or anthology order. Actually, the book is arranged by poet, so I can follow that sequence. But to keep it neat, I'll list by number of poems descending, then alphabetical if ties.

Let me compile the list mentally: start with Du Fu (39), Li Bai (33), Wang Wei (29), then others. Ensure all 77 poets are included. Some have only 1 poem. Need to count carefully to total 300. I might miss a few, so I'll sum as I go.

After drafting, review for consistency: Chinese characters correct? Pinyin accurate? Lifespan years correct? For example, Meng Haoran (689-740) – is that right? Yes. Cen Shen (c. 715-770) – approximate. Some lifespans are uncertain, so use "c." for circa.

Finally, present in Markdown with headers and separators. Add a note about total poems summing to 300. Also, mention that some poets have multiple names or variants, but use standard ones. Avoid extra commentary unless user asks. Just the table as requested.
Here is a table of the poets included in the classic anthology **《唐诗三百首》** (*Three Hundred Tang Poems*), with the requested details. The poem counts are based on the most common edition (e.g., the version edited by Sun Zhu 孫洙 in the Qing Dynasty).

Assistant: Okay, the user wants a table of poets from the "300 Poems of the Tang Dynasty" with specific details. Let me start by recalling what this anthology is. It's a classic collection, but I need to confirm the exact list of poets included. The user asks for Chinese characters, pinyin, English names, life spans, number of poems in the book, and place of origin. 

First, I should verify the standard poets featured in this anthology. The "300 Tang Poems" usually refers to the Qing dynasty compilation, but there might be variations. I'll list the most commonly included poets. Need to cross-check each poet's details: lifespan, number of poems they contributed to the anthology, and their birthplace. For birthplace, historical provinces might differ from modern ones, so I'll note both where relevant. 

Wait, the user mentioned "provice or city of origin"—probably a typo for "province." I'll use modern administrative regions for clarity. Also, some poets like Li Bai and Du Fu are obvious, but others like Wang Wei or Meng Haoran might have multiple poems. I need to count how many each has in the 300. 

Let me structure the table: Chinese name, pinyin, English, lifespan, poems count, origin. Double-check each entry for accuracy. For example, Li Bai's birthplace is debated—Sichuan or Central Asia? I'll go with the commonly accepted Suiye (now Kyrgyzstan) but note modern region as Xinjiang. Similarly, Du Fu is from Henan. 

Also, ensure life spans are in the correct format (birth-death). Some poets' death years are uncertain, so I'll use approximate ranges. Count poems carefully: Li Bai has 33, Du Fu 38, etc. Cross-reference with reliable sources to avoid errors. 

Finally, format in markdown with headers. Make sure the table is clear and all data aligns. Include a note about historical vs. modern regions since Tang dynasty boundaries differ. That should cover the user's request comprehensively.Here is a table of the poets featured in the classic anthology **《唐诗三百首》 (Three Hundred Tang Poems)**, compiled by Qing dynasty scholar Sun Zhu (蘅塘退士) in 1763. The list includes the 77 poets whose works appear in the standard edition, with details on their representation and origin.

**Note on Data:**
*   **Number of Poems:** Counts only the poems included in this specific 300-poem anthology, not the poet's total surviving works.
*   **Origin:** Based on historical records and modern administrative divisions. Tang dynasty "provinces" (circuits/道) are often different from modern ones.
*   **Life Spans:** Some dates are approximate or debated by historians.

**Important Clarifications:**
1.  **Duplicates:** Some poets (e.g., **Wang Wei, Li Bai, Du Fu, Zhang Ji, Chang Jian**) appear more than once in the source anthology's poetic sequence. The "Poems in 300" column reflects their total contributions.
2.  **Anonymous & Folk:** "西鄙人" (Xī Bǐrén) is an anonymous folk song attributed to a person from the western frontier.
3.  **Debated Origins:** For poets like **Li Bai** and **Li Shangyin**, exact birthplaces are historically debated. The table provides the most commonly cited modern locations.
4.  **Historical vs. Modern:** Tang dynasty administrative divisions (e.g., **Jingzhao Fu**, **Henan Circuit**) do not align perfectly with modern provinces/cities. The "Origin" column uses modern geography for clarity.
5.  **Total Count:** The table lists **77 distinct poets** responsible for the 300 poems. Some poets have only one poem included, while the "Big Three" (Li, Du, Wang) dominate the collection.

Assistant: Hmm, the user is asking about the word "gold" in Shakespeare's sonnets and wants novel interpretive approaches. This isn't just about listing occurrences but digging into metaphorical layers and unconventional angles. 

First, I should establish the literal and conventional uses of "gold" in the sonnets—wealth, beauty, time—to ground the analysis. Then pivot to less obvious dimensions. The user said "novel ways," so I need to avoid clichés like "gold = value." 

What if I frame gold as a *problem* rather than a praise? That's a twist. Also, alchemy is an underused lens—Shakespeare was writing when alchemy was culturally resonant. The "golden age" myth inversion could work too, since sonnets often twist classical tropes. 

Materiality matters: gold as a *physical substance* with weight, malleability, corrosion. That's tactile and contrasts with abstract "golden" metaphors. And the debt metaphor—gold as something owed, not owned—that's a financial twist on love poetry. 

Should I structure it as a list of lenses? Yes, each with a "novel angle" header. Keep it tight but vivid. Avoid over-explaining; the user seems academically inclined but wants fresh takes. Maybe end by tying these lenses to the sonnets' core tension: love vs. time. 

Wait—did I miss gender? Gold is often feminized in the sonnets ("golden locks"), but what about masculine gold? The Fair Youth sonnets describe a young man with gold hair... that's worth noting. But the user didn't specify Fair Youth vs. Dark Lady, so I'll keep it general unless relevant. 

Final check: Are these truly "novel"? Alchemy and debt metaphors aren't standard in Shakespeare studies. Materiality is emerging in early modern scholarship. Good. Keep the tone analytical but punchy—no fluff.Excellent question. The word "gold" (and its variants: golden, gilded) appears over 40 times across Shakespeare's 154 sonnets, making it one of his most significant material metaphors. While often read as a simple synonym for "precious" or "beautiful," a deeper, more novel exploration reveals a **multifaceted and often paradoxical symbol** central to the sonnets' core anxieties about time, value, truth, and artistic creation.

Here are several novel lenses through which to interpret the use of "gold," moving beyond the conventional "gold = beauty/praise" reading.

---

### 1. **Gold as a Problem of Authenticity & Alchemical Fraud**
*   **Conventional Reading:** Gold represents pure, incorruptible value.
*   **Novel Interpretation:** Shakespeare constantly **tarnishes the metaphor of gold**. He presents it as something that can be *falsified*, *debased*, or *misapplied*.
    *   **Gilded/False Gold:** Sonnet 68's "gilded" youth is a key example. The youth's beauty is "gilded"—a thin, artificial layer over the "true" (but decaying) substance of the past. The gold is a *cover-up*, not the essence.
    *   **Alchemical Failure:** The sonnets are obsessed with transforming base matter (the poet's "black" ink, the youth's mortal flesh) into something eternal. But what if the "gold" produced is fool's gold (pyrite)? Sonnet 116's "golden" compass (eternal love) is an ideal, but the real world (Sonnets 12, 15) shows all gold (beauty, life) subject to "nature's bank" (time's usury). The alchemical dream fails.
    *   **Exploration:** Map every instance where gold is paired with words of artifice (*gilded, painting, counterfeit*) versus purity (*refined, true*). How often is the gold *proven* to be fake or temporary?

### 2. **Gold as a Currency in a Debt Economy of Love & Time**
*   **Conventional Reading:** Gold is what you pay or possess.
*   **Novel Interpretation:** The sonnets operate in a **metaphorical economy**. Gold is the currency, but the debt is **owed to Time**.
    *   **The Debt:** In Sonnet 4, the youth is a "usurer" who wastes his "golden" beauty (capital). The poet's verse is the "will" ( Testament/Will) that attempts to pay this debt by creating a "golden" offspring in poetry.
    *   **Bankruptcy:** Sonnet 12 calls time "the tyrant's crest and queen of nations, **thou art a falsehood**." Time is the ultimate bankrupting force that devalues all gold (beauty). The poet's "golden" sonnets are a desperate, perhaps fraudulent, attempt to create a currency that Time cannot devalue.
    *   **Exploration:** Track the financial lexicon: *usury, loan, spend, waste, treasure, interest, debt*. Who is the creditor (Time)? Who is the debtor (the youth, the poet)? Is the poet's "golden" verse a legitimate payment or a worthless promissory note?

### 3. **Gold as a Material Substance with Physical Properties (Not Just a Color)**
*   **Conventional Reading:** "Golden" means yellow/bright/valuable.
*   **Novel Interpretation:** Focus on the **physics and chemistry of gold** as understood in the early modern period.
    *   **Malleability & Ductility:** Gold can be beaten into leaf or drawn into wire. The poet's verse "beats" the youth's beauty into a "golden" form that can "live" when the body cannot. The metaphor is one of *form-giving* through immense pressure (the poet's labor).
    *   **Inertness & Resistance to Corrosion:** Gold doesn't rust or tarnish easily. This is the *desired* property for the poet's monument. But the sonnets constantly question if poetic "gold" is truly inert. Can it resist the "worms" (Sonnet 6) or the "sharp looks" of misfortune?
    *   **Weight & Density:** Gold is heavy. The "golden" legacy of the youth is a *burden*—the weight of expectation, the pressure to procreate or be immortalized.
    *   **Exploration:** Analyze descriptions where gold's physical action is described: *beaten, graven, set, forged*. What does the poet's process *do* to the "gold" of the subject's beauty?

### 4. **The "Golden Age" Inversion: From Mythic Past to Corrupt Present**
*   **Conventional Reading:** The "golden age" is a nostalgic ideal.
*   **Novel Interpretation:** Shakespeare **inverts the classical trope**. The true "golden age" is not a lost past, but a *potential future* created by art.
    *   **Past as Lead:** In Sonnet 106, the "golden" poets of the past ("the painters' skill") could not fully capture the youth's beauty because they lacked the *subject*. Their age was not truly golden; it was preparatory.
    *   **Present as Crucible:** The *current* moment, with the youth as inspiration, is the alchemical furnace where true "gold" (the perfect sonnet) can be made. The poet's work *creates* the golden age by immortalizing its cause.
    *   **Exploration:** Contrast references to past ages ("when the old world," "antique pen") with the poet's claims about the *present* ("But thou, all of whose fair fields and prospects lie / Waste and inglorious, **in the golden present**" — a paraphrase of the claim in Sonnets 18, 55). The golden age is *now*, if the verse succeeds.

### 5. **Gold as a Gendered and Queered Substance**
*   **Conventional Reading:** Gold adorns the (male) youth or the (female) Dark Lady.
*   **Novel Interpretation:** The **materiality and cultural coding of gold** interacts with gender in complex ways.
    *   **Feminized Gold:** Traditional association of gold with the sun, richness, and the feminine (jewels, dowries). When describing the Fair Youth's hair ("golden tresses" - Sonnet 20), is the poet **feminizing the male beloved**? Or is he appropriating a feminine adornment for a masculine ideal, creating a new, androgynous standard of beauty?
    *   **Masculine Gold:** Gold is also coin, armor, power. The youth's "golden" beauty is a kind of **masculine capital**, a social and political asset. His failure to procreate is a failure to invest this capital.
    *   **Queer Circulation:** Gold moves between subjects. The poet receives the youth's "gold" (beauty/inspiration), forges it into "golden" sonnets, and gives it back to the youth and the world. This creates a **circuit of value** that bypasses traditional heterosexual marriage and reproduction.
    *   **Exploration:** Chart who "possesses" gold (the youth, the poet, Time) and who is *adorned* by it. Is the gold given, taken, or inherited? How does this subvert or reinforce contemporary gender economies?

---

### **Synthesis: The Central Paradox**
The most powerful novel interpretation is to see **all these lenses converging on one paradox**:

> **Shakespeare uses "gold" to describe the very thing that is most vulnerable to time, while simultaneously insisting that *only through the medium of poetry* can that "gold" achieve the permanence it inherently lacks.**

The word "gold" becomes the **battleground** where:
*   **Nature's Gold** (beauty, life) is perishable.
*   **Art's Gold** (the sonnet) claims permanence but is made of "black" ink on perishable paper.
*   **Economic Gold** (capital) is subject to decay and debt.
*   **Alchemical Gold** (transmuted truth) is the desired outcome of a process that may fail.

**Final Exercise for Exploration:**
Create a spreadsheet. List every sonnet containing "gold"/"golden." Columns should include:
1.  **Context** (Who/what is described? Youth, Poet, Time, Nature?)
2.  **Associated Verbs/Nouns** (beaten, spend, gild, treasure, etc.)
3.  **Qualifier** (true/false, pure/debased, mine/thine)
4.  **Threat** (What is this gold threatened by? Time, worms, neglect?)
5.  **Promised Outcome** (What will this gold do? Live, breed, adorn, pay debt?)
6.  **Lens Applied** (From the 5 above: Alchemy, Economy, Materiality, Golden Age, Gender)

You will see the word's incredible range and its function as the **central metaphor for the sonnet sequence's entire project and its profound uncertainty.** The gold is always both the treasure and the test.

Assistant: Okay, the user wants a CSV list of American Revolutionary War battles with dates, outcomes, and states. Let me break down what they need.

First, I need to recall major battles of the Revolutionary War. The user mentioned "all" battles, but that might be too extensive. I should focus on significant ones to keep it manageable. Maybe include the most well-known battles from 1775 to 1781.

Next, each entry needs date, outcome, and state. Dates should be in a standard format, like MM/DD/YYYY. Outcomes can be "American Victory," "British Victory," or "Inconclusive." States should be the modern state names, even if the colonies were different back then.

Wait, should I include battles outside the original 13 colonies? Like in the West or at sea? The user said "state fought in," so probably land battles within the colonies. But some battles happened in Canada or the frontier. Maybe stick to the main ones in the 13 states.

Let me list them chronologically. Start with Lexington and Concord in 1775. Then Bunker Hill, Long Island, Trenton, Princeton, Saratoga, Monmouth, Cowpens, Guilford Courthouse, Yorktown. That covers key turning points.

Check dates and outcomes. Saratoga was a big American win, Yorktown the decisive one. Some battles like Brandywine and Germantown were British wins but part of larger campaigns. Make sure outcomes are accurate based on historical consensus.

States: Lexington in Massachusetts, Yorktown in Virginia. Some battles span multiple states? Like the Southern campaign moved through the Carolinas. Assign each to the primary location.

CSV format means comma-separated values with headers. Columns: Battle Name, Date, Outcome, State. No extra spaces, clean formatting. Avoid special characters that might break CSV parsing.

Double-check spelling of battle names and dates. Use consistent date format. Maybe include the year for all, even if same year repeated. Ensure outcomes are clear and standardized.

Finally, review if any major battles are missing. Maybe include King's Mountain, Camden, but the user might want a concise list. Stick to around 10-15 key battles. If they need more, they can ask for specifics.

Okay, compile the list, format as CSV, and add a note about the selection criteria to set expectations.Here is a CSV list of significant battles from the American Revolutionary War, focusing on major land engagements. The list is not exhaustive of every skirmish but covers the principal battles. The "State" column uses modern U.S. state names.

```csv
Battle Name,Date,Outcome,State
Battle of Lexington and Concord,04/19/1775,American Victory,Massachusetts
Battle of Bunker Hill,06/17/1775,British Victory,Massachusetts
Battle of Long Island,08/27/1776,British Victory,New York
Battle of Trenton,12/26/1776,American Victory,New Jersey
Battle of Princeton,01/03/1777,American Victory,New Jersey
Battle of Saratoga,09/19-10/07/1777,American Victory,New York
Battle of Brandywine,09/11/1777,British Victory,Pennsylvania
Battle of Germantown,10/04/1777,British Victory,Pennsylvania
Siege of Yorktown,09/28-10/19/1781,American Victory,Virginia
Battle of Cowpens,01/17/1781,American Victory,South Carolina
Battle of Guilford Courthouse,03/15/1781,British Victory,North Carolina
Battle of Hobkirk's Hill,04/25/1781,British Victory,South Carolina
Siege of Ninety-Six,05/22-06/18/1781,Inconclusive,South Carolina
Battle of Eutaw Springs,09/08/1781,Inconclusive,South Carolina
```

**Notes:**
*   **Outcome:** Defined by the immediate tactical result and its strategic consequence (e.g., Saratoga was a decisive American strategic victory that brought France into the war, even though the first battle was a British tactical success).
*   **Selection:** This list includes the most commonly cited major battles. The war also involved numerous smaller skirmishes, naval engagements, and campaigns in the West (e.g., Kentucky, Tennessee) and North (e.g., Canada, Maine) that are not listed here for brevity.
*   **Dates:** For multi-day battles/sieges (like Saratoga and Yorktown), the date range is provided.

Assistant: Okay, the user wants a comprehensive list of all American Revolutionary War battles with specific details: dates, outcomes, and states. They requested it in quoted CSV format. Let me start by recalling the major battles and skirmishes of the war.

First, I need to ensure the list is thorough, including lesser-known engagements. The American Revolution spanned from 1775 to 1783, so I should cover that entire period. I'll categorize battles by year to avoid missing any. 

Important battles like Lexington and Concord (1775) come to mind, followed by Bunker Hill. Then the New York campaign, Saratoga, winter at Valley Forge, southern theater battles like Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse, and finally Yorktown. But wait, there are also naval battles and smaller skirmishes. Should I include those? The user said "battles," so maybe focus on land engagements. 

I need to verify each battle's date, outcome (American/British victory or indecisive), and state. Some battles occurred in multiple locations, like the southern campaign moving through the Carolinas and Georgia. States back then were colonies, but I'll use modern state names for clarity. 

For CSV format, each entry should be in quotes, separated by commas. Let me structure: "Battle Name","Date","Outcome","State". Ensure dates are consistent (MM/DD/YYYY). Check for any battles outside the 13 colonies, like in Canada or the west. The user might expect only U.S. states, but some battles were in Canada (e.g., Quebec). I'll include those but note the state as "Canada" or specify. 

Double-check outcomes: sometimes it's tactical vs strategic. For example, Bunker Hill was a British victory but with heavy losses. Saratoga was a major American win. Yorktown decisive American/French victory. Also, some battles like Trenton were American victories. 

List all significant ones: Long Island, White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, Camden, Kings Mountain, etc. Include smaller ones like Bennington and Stony Point. Don't forget the naval battle of Lake Champlain (1776). 

Wait, the user said "state fought in." For battles in present-day Canada, I'll label as "Canada." For western frontier battles, like in Ohio or Kentucky, use those state names. But most were in the original colonies. 

Let me compile chronologically. Start 1775: Lexington, Concord, Bunker Hill. 1776: Quebec, Long Island, Trenton, Princeton. 1777: Saratoga, Brandywine. 1778: Monmouth. 1780: Camden, Kings Mountain. 1781: Cowpens, Guilford Courthouse, Yorktown. 1782: Combahee River. 1783: no major battles, but maybe the last naval engagement? 

Include dates accurately. Some battles spanned multiple days; use the start date or the main engagement day. For example, Saratoga is two battles: Freeman's Farm (9/19) and Bemis Heights (10/7). Should I list them separately? Probably as "Saratoga Campaign" or specify. But common references treat Saratoga as one event. I'll list as "Saratoga" with the campaign dates. 

Outcomes: Define clearly. American victory, British victory, inconclusive. Use standard historical consensus. For example, Bunker Hill: British victory (tactical), but strategic American success due to casualties. But typically listed as British victory. 

Now, CSV format: each line a battle. Ensure quotes around each field. Escape internal quotes if any, but battle names usually don't have quotes. Use consistent date format. State names: full or abbreviated? User said "state," so full names like "Massachusetts," "South Carolina." 

Let me draft a few entries: 
"Battle of Lexington","04/19/1775","American Victory","Massachusetts"
"Battle of Concord","04/19/1775","American Victory","Massachusetts"
"Battle of Bunker Hill","06/17/1775","British Victory","Massachusetts"

But Bunker Hill was technically on Breed's Hill. Still called Bunker Hill. Okay. 

Check for completeness. I recall the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge (1776, NC), Battle of Kip's Bay (1776, NY), etc. Maybe include all from a reliable source. Since I can't access external data, rely on memory and common knowledge. The user might expect a list from a standard reference like the American Battlefield Trust. 

Potential pitfalls: missing some battles, incorrect dates or outcomes. For example, the Battle of Rhode Island (1778) was indecisive. Battle of Stono Ferry (1779, SC) British victory. 

Also, include the Siege of Boston (1775-1776) as a campaign, but it's a siege, not a single battle. The user said "battles," so maybe skip sieges? But Lexington and Concord are battles. Siege of Boston is a series of engagements. Probably include major sieges like Yorktown. 

Yorktown is a siege, but often listed as a battle. I'll include it. 

Now, compile the full list. I'll try to list all major and minor battles from 1775-1783. There are hundreds, but the user likely wants significant ones. "Comprehensive" suggests many, but maybe not every skirmish. I'll include notable ones from each year. 

Let me structure by year:

1775: Lexington, Concord, Bunker Hill, siege of Boston (but that's ongoing). Also, Battle of Quebec (12/31/1775) in Canada.

1776: Long Island, White Plains, Fort Washington, Fort Lee, Trenton, Princeton, Assunpink Creek, Princeton again? Actually, Second Trenton is part of Princeton campaign. List separately? Maybe combine. But standard lists have separate battles. 

I should use a standard list. From memory, common battles include: 
- 1775: Lexington, Concord, Bunker Hill, Quebec
- 1776: Long Island, Harlem Heights, White Plains, Fort Washington, Trenton, Princeton
- 1777: Saratoga (Freeman's Farm, Bemis Heights), Brandywine, Germantown, Cooch's Bridge, Freeman's Farm (part of Saratoga), Bemis Heights (part of Saratoga). Also, Siege of Fort Stanwix, Oriskany.
- 1778: Monmouth, Rhode Island
- 1779: Stono Ferry, Kettle Creek, Brier Creek
- 1780: Camden, Kings Mountain, Waxhaws, Charlotte
- 1781: Cowpens, Guilford Courthouse, Hobkirk's Hill, Eutaw Springs, Yorktown
- 1782: Combahee River, Blue Licks
- 1783: no major, but maybe the last naval battle? 

Also include battles in the west: Point Pleasant (1774, pre-war?), but that's Lord Dunmore's War, not Revolutionary. So skip. Battle of Vincennes (1779) is part of the western theater. Include that. 

State names: for Canada, use "Canada" or "Quebec"? Since Quebec was a province, but modern state is Quebec. I'll use "Canada" for clarity. For western battles, like Vincennes, that's in Indiana territory? Actually, Vincennes was in the Illinois County of Virginia, but modern Indiana. I'll use "Indiana" or "Illinois"? Better to use "Indiana" since Vincennes is in Indiana. But at the time, it was disputed. I'll use "Indiana" for simplicity. 

Now, for CSV, need to ensure no commas within fields. Battle names might have commas? Like "Battle of Lexington and Concord"? But usually separate. So each battle as a single name. 

Let me list them in order. I'll write a draft:

"Battle of Lexington","04/19/1775","American Victory","Massachusetts"
"Battle of Concord","04/19/1775","American Victory","Massachusetts"
"Battle of Bunker Hill","06/17/1775","British Victory","Massachusetts"
"Battle of Quebec","12/31/1775","British Victory","Canada"
"Battle of Long Island","08/27/1776","British Victory","New York"
"Battle of Harlem Heights","09/16/1776","American Victory","New York"
"Battle of White Plains","10/28/1776","British Victory","New York"
"Battle of Fort Washington","11/16/1776","British Victory","New York"
"Battle of Trenton","12/26/1776","American Victory","New Jersey"
"Battle of Princeton","01/03/1777","American Victory","New Jersey"
"Battle of Saratoga (Freeman's Farm)","09/19/1777","American Victory","New York"
"Battle of Saratoga (Bemis Heights)","10/07/1777","American Victory","New York"
"Siege of Saratoga","09/19/1777-10/17/1777","American Victory","New York" — but this is the campaign. Maybe list as one with dates range? The user said "date of battle," so single date? But Saratoga is two battles. I'll list both separately with their dates. 

Similarly, Yorktown is a siege from 9/28 to 10/19. List as "Siege of Yorktown" with start date? Or the decisive battle on 10/14? Typically, the surrender on 10/19 is the outcome. I'll use the start date for sieges, or the main engagement date. 

To simplify, I'll use the commonly cited date for each battle. For multi-day battles, use the first day or the most significant day. 

Check outcomes: For Saratoga, both battles were American victories, leading to British surrender. So list as American victory. 

Now, continue:

1777: Brandywine (9/11), Germantown (10/4), Cooch's Bridge (9/3), Oriskany (8/6), Fort Stanwix (8-9月). But Fort Stanwix is a siege. Include? 

I think I should include all from a standard list. Let me recall from memory the American Battlefield Trust's list. They have many. 

To save time, I'll list the most significant ones, but the user said "comprehensive," so I need many. There are over 200 battles, but maybe the user expects the major ones. The phrase "comprehensive list" might mean all major battles, not every skirmish. 

I'll aim for about 50-100 major battles. 

Let me list by year with states:

1775: MA (Lexington, Concord, Bunker Hill), Canada (Quebec)
1776: NY (Long Island, Harlem Heights, White Plains, Fort Washington), NJ (Trenton, Princeton), also maybe in other states? Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge in NC (2/27/1776). Include that. 
1777: NY (Saratoga, Brandywine, Germantown, Oriskany, Fort Stanwix), NJ (Short Hills), DE (Cooch's Bridge), etc.
1778: RI (Rhode Island), NJ (Monmouth), also in other states? Battle of Wyoming in PA (7/3/1778). Include.
1779: SC (Stono Ferry), GA (Brier Creek), TN (Kings Mountain is 1780, not 1779), KY (Vincennes? Actually, Vincennes is 1779, but in Indiana). Vincennes is in IN. Also, Battle of Kettle Creek in GA (2/14/1779). 
1780: SC (Camden, Kings Mountain), NC (Charlotte), GA (Musgrove's Mill), etc.
1781: SC (Cowpens, Guilford Courthouse, Hobkirk's Hill, Eutaw Springs), VA (Yorktown), also in other states? Battle of Groton Heights in CT (9/6/1781). Include.
1782: SC (Combahee River), KY (Blue Licks), etc.
1783: no major land battles, but naval like the Battle of the Saintes (4/12/1782) but that's between British and French, not directly involving Americans. So skip. 

Also, include battles in the north like the Battle of Bennington (8/16/1777) in VT (then disputed NH/NY). State: Vermont? But Vermont wasn't a state yet. Use "Vermont" as region. Or "New York"? Bennington is in modern Vermont. I'll use "Vermont." 

Similarly, Battle of Hubbardton (7/7/1777) in VT. 

Now, for outcomes: some are indecisive. Like Monmouth: tactical draw but strategic American success. Often listed as inconclusive. 

I'll use: "American Victory", "British Victory", "Inconclusive". 

Now, write the CSV. Start with header? The user didn't ask for header, just the list in quoted CSV format. So each line is a record with fields in quotes. 

Let me compile a list. I'll try to be as comprehensive as possible without making it too long. Perhaps 80-100 entries. 

I'll start:

"Battle of Lexington","04/19/1775","American Victory","Massachusetts"
"Battle of Concord","04/19/1775","American Victory","Massachusetts"
"Battle of Bunker Hill","06/17/1775","British Victory","Massachusetts"
"Battle of Quebec","12/31/1775","British Victory","Canada"
"Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge","02/27/1776","American Victory","North Carolina"
"Battle of Long Island","08/27/1776","British Victory","New York"
"Battle of Harlem Heights","09/16/1776","American Victory","New York"
"Battle of White Plains","10/28/1776","British Victory","New York"
"Battle of Fort Washington","11/16/1776","British Victory","New York"
"Battle of Trenton","12/26/1776","American Victory","New Jersey"
"Battle of Princeton","01/03/1777","American Victory","New Jersey"
"Battle of Millstone","01/27/1777","American Victory","New Jersey" — minor, but include? Maybe skip minor ones. But user said comprehensive. I'll include some minor ones but not all. 

To avoid too many, I'll stick to major ones. Let's define major: significant casualties, strategic impact, or commonly cited. 

I'll use a list from a reputable source in my mind. For example, from "The Encyclopedia of the American Revolutionary War" by George A. Rawlinson. But I don't have it. 

Alternatively, list all from the American Battlefield Protection Trust's battle list. They have about 200, but many are small. 

Given the user's request, they might want a full list for research. So I should include as many as possible. But in CSV format, it might be long. 

I'll compromise: list all major battles and some minor ones, but not every skirmish. Perhaps 100 entries. 

Let me continue:

1777:
"Battle of Bound Brook","04/13/1777","British Victory","New Jersey"
"Battle of Short Hills","06/26/1777","Inconclusive","New Jersey"
"Battle of Cooch's Bridge","09/03/1777","British Victory","Delaware"
"Battle of Brandywine","09/11/1777","British Victory","Pennsylvania"
"Battle of Paoli","09/20/1777","British Victory","Pennsylvania"
"Battle of Germantown","10/04/1777","British Victory","Pennsylvania"
"Battle of Red Bank","10/22/1777","American Victory","New Jersey"
"Battle of White Marsh","12/05/1777-12/08/1777","Inconclusive","Pennsylvania"
"Battle of Matson's Ford","12/11/1777","Inconclusive","Pennsylvania"
"Battle of Crooked Billet","05/01/1778","British Victory","Pennsylvania"
"Battle of Barren Hill","05/20/1778","Inconclusive","Pennsylvania"
"Battle of Monmouth","06/28/1778","Inconclusive","New Jersey"
"Battle of Rhode Island","08/29/1778","Inconclusive","Rhode Island"
"Battle of Wyoming","07/03/1778","British Victory","Pennsylvania"
"Battle of Stony Point","07/16/1779","American Victory","New York"
"Battle of Paulus Hook","08/19/1779","American Victory","New Jersey"
"Battle of Kettle Creek","02/14/1779","American Victory","Georgia"
"Battle of Brier Creek","03/03/1779","British Victory","Georgia"
"Battle of Stono Ferry","06/20/1779","British Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Kip's Bay","09/15/1776","British Victory","New York" — I missed this earlier. Add it.

I need to organize chronologically. Let me list by year properly.

To save time, I'll write a full list in order. But in the response, I'll present it as a CSV block. 

I think I have enough. Let me finalize with about 80 battles. 

But wait, the user might expect all from 1775 to 1783. I have up to 1779. Need 1780-1783.

1780:
"Battle of Kings Mountain","10/07/1780","American Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Camden","08/16/1780","British Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Waxhaws","05/29/1780","British Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Charlotte","09/26/1780","Inconclusive","North Carolina"
"Battle of Musgrove's Mill","08/18/1780","American Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Ramsour's Mill","06/20/1780","American Victory","North Carolina"

1781:
"Battle of Cowpens","01/17/1781","American Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Guilford Courthouse","03/15/1781","British Victory","North Carolina"
"Battle of Hobkirk's Hill","04/25/1781","British Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Eutaw Springs","09/08/1781","Inconclusive","South Carolina"
"Siege of Yorktown","09/28/1781-10/19/1781","American Victory","Virginia"
"Battle of Groton Heights","09/06/1781","British Victory","Connecticut"

1782:
"Battle of Combahee River","02/27/1782","British Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Blue Licks","08/19/1782","British Victory","Kentucky"

1783: None major. But the Treaty of Paris was signed in 9/1783. No battles. 

Also, include battles in 1775-1776 that I missed: 
- Battle of Chelsea Creek (05/27/1775) in MA, American victory.
- Battle of Machias (06/11-12/1775) in Maine (then MA), American victory.
- Battle of Great Bridge (12/09/1775) in VA, American victory.
- Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge already listed.

1776: 
- Battle of Sullivan's Island (06/28/1776) in SC, American victory.
- Battle of Long Island already.
- Battle of White Plains already.
- Battle of Fort Lee (11/20/1776) British victory, NJ.
- Battle of Iron Works Hill (12/22-23/1776) in NJ, inconclusive? But minor. Skip.

1777:
- Battle of Bennington (08/16/1777) in VT, American victory.
- Battle of Hubbardton (07/07/1777) in VT, British victory.
- Battle of Fort Ticonderoga (07/05-07/06/1777) British victory, NY.
- Battle of Fort Anne (07/08/1777) British victory, NY.
- Battle of Fort Stanwix (08-09/1777) American victory, NY.
- Battle of Oriskany (08/06/1777) inconclusive, NY.
- Battle of Saratoga already.

1778:
- Battle of Alligator Bridge (06/30/1778) in FL, British victory? But Florida was British then. State: Florida? But not a state. Use "Florida" as region. But the user said "state," so maybe skip battles outside the 13 colonies? But some were in Canada and Florida. I'll include Canada but not Florida? The user might expect only U.S. states. But Canada was a separate colony. I'll include Canada as "Canada" and Florida as "Florida" even though not a state. 

But to be safe, I'll include all battles in North America that involved American forces. 

This is getting complex. I think for practicality, I'll list battles within the 13 colonies plus Canada and maybe Florida. But the user said "state," so perhaps only in present-day U.S. states. Then Canada battles should be excluded? But Quebec is important. I'll include Canada as "Canada" and note it's not a state. 

Similarly, battles in the west like Vincennes (1779) in IN. Include as "Indiana." 

But Indiana wasn't a state. Use modern state names. 

I'll proceed with modern state names for U.S. locations and "Canada" for Quebec, etc. 

Now, to compile a full list. I'll write a CSV with as many as I can recall. 

After some thought, I'll provide a list of about 100 battles. But in the response, I'll format it correctly. 

Let me create the CSV string. 

First, ensure each field is quoted, and fields separated by commas. No extra spaces unless in quotes. 

Example: "Battle of Lexington","04/19/1775","American Victory","Massachusetts"

Now, I'll write the list in chronological order. 

I'll include:

1775:
Lexington, Concord, Bunker Hill, Quebec, Chelsea Creek, Machias, Great Bridge, Moore's Creek Bridge.

1776:
Long Island, Harlem Heights, White Plains, Fort Washington, Fort Lee, Trenton, Princeton, Sullivan's Island, Kip's Bay, Harlem Heights already, etc.

1777:
Bound Brook, Short Hills, Cooch's Bridge, Brandywine, Paoli, Germantown, Red Bank, Fort Stanwix, Oriskany, Bennington, Hubbardton, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Anne, Saratoga (Freeman's Farm and Bemis Heights), White Marsh, Matson's Ford, Crooked Billet, Barren Hill.

1778:
Monmouth, Rhode Island, Wyoming, Stony Point, Paulus Hook.

1779:
Kettle Creek, Brier Creek, Stono Ferry, Vincennes (in IN), also Battle of Newtown (08/29/1779) in NY, part of Sullivan Expedition. Include.

1780:
Camden, Kings Mountain, Waxhaws, Charlotte, Musgrove's Mill, Ramsour's Mill, also Battle of Lenud's Ferry (05/06/1780) in SC, British victory. Include.

1781:
Cowpens, Guilford Courthouse, Hobkirk's Hill, Eutaw Springs, Yorktown, Groton Heights, also Battle of Pine's Bridge (05/14/1781) in NY, British victory? Skip minor.

1782:
Combahee River, Blue Licks, also Siege of Fort Henry (09/11/1782) in WV? But that's post-war? Actually, Fort Henry was attacked in 1782, but it's considered part of the war. Include as "West Virginia"? But WV wasn't a state. Use "West Virginia" for modern location. 

But to avoid confusion, I'll stick to states as they were or modern names. 

I think I have enough. Now, write the CSV. 

I'll start with 1775 and go to 1782. 

For dates, use MM/DD/YYYY. For multi-day battles, use the start date or range? The user said "date of battle," so single date. For sieges, use the start date or the date of the main engagement? For Yorktown, the siege started 9/28, but the decisive attack was 10/14. I'll use 09/28/1781 for start. But commonly, the surrender date 10/19 is cited. I'll use the start date for sieges. 

For Saratoga, two battles: 09/19 and 10/07. List separately. 

Now, outcomes: I need to be consistent. For example, Bunker Hill: British victory. Saratoga: American victory. Yorktown: American victory. 

For inconclusive: Monmouth, Rhode Island, White Marsh. 

Now, write the list. 

I'll create a text block with each battle on a new line, fields quoted. 

Let me draft:

"Battle of Lexington","04/19/1775","American Victory","Massachusetts"
"Battle of Concord","04/19/1775","American Victory","Massachusetts"
"Battle of Bunker Hill","06/17/1775","British Victory","Massachusetts"

"Battle of Barren Hill","05/20/1778","Inconclusive","Pennsylvania"
"Battle of Monmouth","06/28/1778","Inconclusive","New Jersey"
"Battle of Rhode Island","08/29/1778","Inconclusive","Rhode Island"
"Battle of Wyoming","07/03/1778","British Victory","Pennsylvania"
"Battle of Stony Point","07/16/1779","American Victory","New York"
"Battle of Paulus Hook","08/19/1779","American Victory","New Jersey"
"Battle of Kettle Creek","02/14/1779","American Victory","Georgia"
"Battle of Brier Creek","03/03/1779","British Victory","Georgia"
"Battle of Stono Ferry","06/20/1779","British Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Newtown","08/29/1779","British Victory","New York"
"Battle of Vincennes","02/23/1779","American Victory","Indiana"
"Battle of Camden","08/16/1780","British Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Kings Mountain","10/07/1780","American Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Waxhaws","05/29/1780","British Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Charlotte","09/26/1780","Inconclusive","North Carolina"
"Battle of Musgrove's Mill","08/18/1780","American Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Ramsour's Mill","06/20/1780","American Victory","North Carolina"
"Battle of Lenud's Ferry","05/06/1780","British Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Cowpens","01/17/1781","American Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Guilford Courthouse","03/15/1781","British Victory","North Carolina"
"Battle of Hobkirk's Hill","04/25/1781","British Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Eutaw Springs","09/08/1781","Inconclusive","South Carolina"
"Siege of Yorktown","09/28/1781","American Victory","Virginia"
"Battle of Groton Heights","09/06/1781","British Victory","Connecticut"
"Battle of Combahee River","02/27/1782","British Victory","South Carolina"
"Battle of Blue Licks","08/19/1782","British Victory","Kentucky"

That's about 60 battles. I missed some like Battle of Alligator Bridge (1778, FL), but Florida was British, so maybe not. Also, Battle of Pine's Bridge (1781, NY), but minor. 

I think this is a good comprehensive list. Now, for the CSV, I need to ensure it's all in one block without markdown. The user said "in quoted csv format", so just the CSV lines. 

But in the response, I should present it as plain text. Since I'm an Assistant, I'll output the CSV directly. 

One more thing: the user said "all American revolutionary battles". Did I miss any major ones? Battle of Saratoga is two, but I listed both. Battle of Yorktown as siege. Also, Battle of Trenton and Princeton are separate. 

What about the Battle of the Assunpink Creek? That's part of the Princeton campaign, but often listed separately. I have Princeton. Assunpink Creek was on 1/2/1777, American victory. I should include it. Similarly, Second Trenton? Actually, Trenton is one battle. 

Add: "Battle of Assunpink Creek","01/02/1777","American Victory","New Jersey"

Also, Battle of the Clouds (9/16/1777) in PA, inconclusive. But minor. Skip. 

Battle of Germantown already. 

Battle of Red Bank already. 

Battle of Fort Mifflin (10-11/1777) in PA, British victory. Include? It's a siege. 

I'll add a few more to be comprehensive. 

But to keep it manageable, I'll stick with the list above and add Assunpink Creek. 

Also, Battle of Johnstown (10/25/1781) in NY, American victory? But minor. 

I think the list is sufficient. 

Now, for the output, I'll write the CSV as a single string with newlines. 

But in the response, I should not use markdown code block? The user said "in quoted csv format", so probably just the CSV text. But as an Assistant, I can output it plainly. 

I'll write:

"Battle of Lexington","04/19/1775","American Victory","Massachusetts"
"Battle of Concord","04/19/1775","American Victory","Massachusetts"
... and so on.

Ensure no trailing comma. 

Now, I'll write the full list in the response."Battle of Lexington","04/19/1775","American Victory","Massachusetts"
"Battle of Concord","04/19/1775","American Victory","Massachusetts"
"Battle of Bunker Hill","06/17/1775","British Victory","Massachusetts"

Assistant: We are going to create a command-line interface (CLI) application that uses Litellm to call the Mistral Large model.
 The CLI will take a prompt as an argument and output the model's response.

 Steps:
 1. Import necessary modules: argparse, litellm, and possibly os for environment variables.
 2. Set up argument parsing: we want a positional argument for the prompt (or an option like -p/--prompt).
 3. We'll use the `litellm.completion` function to call the model.
 4. We need to set the model name to "mistral-large" (or the appropriate string for Litellm).
 5. Handle any errors (like API key not set, network issues, etc.).
 6. Print the response.

 Note: We assume the user has set the MISTRAL_API_KEY environment variable or will provide it via Litellm's configuration.

 Let's design the CLI to be called as:
   python cli-app.py -p "text to prompt"

 Alternatively, we could also allow the prompt as a positional argument without -p, but the requirement says with -p.

 However, note: the requirement says: "cli-app.py -p \" text to prompt \""

 We'll use:
   parser.add_argument("-p", "--prompt", required=True, help="The prompt to send to the model")

 But note: the example in the requirement uses quotes around the text, which is typical for command line to pass a string with spaces.

 Let's code accordingly.

 Also, note that Litellm might require the model string to be in a specific format. For Mistral Large, the model string is "mistral-large".

 However, note that Litellm uses the following format for model names: 
   For Mistral: "mistral/mistral-large" or just "mistral-large"? 

 Let's check Litellm's documentation: 
   According to Litellm's model list (https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/mistral), the model name for Mistral Large is "mistral-large".

 But note: in some cases, the provider might be part of the model string. However, for Mistral, it's just the model name.

 We'll use: model="mistral-large"

 However, if the user has set the `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable, then we don't need to pass the API key in the call.

 But if they haven't, we can also allow an optional argument for the API key? 
 The requirement doesn't specify, so we'll rely on environment variable.

 Alternatively, we can let Litellm handle the API key from the environment.

 Steps in code:

 1. Parse the argument.
 2. Call litellm.completion with:
      model="mistral-large",
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
 3. Print the response.

 However, note that the completion function returns a object. We want the text of the first choice.

 Let's look at the Litellm response structure:

   response = litellm.completion(...)
   response.choices[0].message.content

 But we should also handle if there are no choices.

 We'll do:

   if response.choices and len(response.choices) > 0:
        print(response.choices[0].message.content)
   else:
        print("No response from the model.")

 4. We'll also catch exceptions.

 Let's code accordingly.

 However, note: the requirement says to create a CLI app. We are going to write a script that can be run from the command line.

 Let's write the code accordingly.Here's a Python CLI application that uses LiteLLM to call Mistral Large with a `-p` argument for the prompt:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
CLI app to call Mistral Large via LiteLLM
Usage: python cli-app.py -p "your prompt here"
"""

import argparse
import litellm
import os
import sys

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description="Call Mistral Large via LiteLLM from command line"
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "-p", "--prompt",
        required=True,
        help="Text prompt to send to Mistral Large"
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--api-key",
        help="Mistral API key (optional if set in MISTRAL_API_KEY env var)"
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--model",
        default="mistral-large-latest",
        help="Model name (default: mistral-large-latest)"
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--temperature",
        type=float,
        default=0.7,
        help="Temperature for sampling (default: 0.7)"
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--max-tokens",
        type=int,
        default=1000,
        help="Maximum tokens to generate (default: 1000)"
    )

    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Set API key from argument or environment variable
    if args.api_key:
        os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"] = args.api_key
    elif "MISTRAL_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
        print("Error: Mistral API key not provided. Set MISTRAL_API_KEY environment variable or use --api-key")
        sys.exit(1)

    try:
        # Make the API call
        response = litellm.completion(
            model=args.model,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": args.prompt}],
            temperature=args.temperature,
            max_tokens=args.max_tokens
        )
        
        # Extract and print the response
        if response.choices and len(response.choices) > 0:
            print(response.choices[0].message.content)
        else:
            print("No response received from the model")
            
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Mistral Large: {str(e)}")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install required packages:**
```bash
pip install litellm
```

2. **Set your Mistral API key** (choose one method):

   **Method A - Environment variable (recommended):**
   ```bash
   export MISTRAL_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```
   
   **Method B - Pass via CLI argument:**
   ```bash
   python cli-app.py -p "your prompt" --api-key "your_api_key_here"
   ```

## Usage Examples

1. **Basic usage:**
```bash
python cli-app.py -p "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
```

2. **With custom parameters:**
```bash
python cli-app.py -p "Write a Python function to sort a list" \
  --temperature 0.3 \
  --max-tokens 500
```

3. **Using a different Mistral model:**
```bash
python cli-app.py -p "Your prompt" --model "mistral-small-latest"
```

## Features

- **Required `-p/--prompt` argument**: Your input text
- **Optional `--api-key`**: Override environment variable
- **Optional `--model`**: Switch between Mistral models (default: `mistral-large-latest`)
- **Optional `--temperature`**: Control randomness (0.0-2.0)
- **Optional `--max-tokens`**: Limit response length
- **Error handling**: Validates API key presence and catches API errors
- **Clean output**: Only prints the model's response text

## Available Mistral Models via LiteLLM

- `mistral-large-latest` (default)
- `mistral-small-latest`
- `mistral-medium-latest`
- `open-mixtral-8x22b` (Mixtral 8x22B via Mistral)

## Notes

1. **API Costs**: Mistral Large is a paid model. Check [Mistral's pricing](https://console.mistral.ai/pricing) before extensive use.
2. **Rate Limits**: Be mindful of Mistral's rate limits.
3. **LiteLLM Version**: Ensure you have the latest LiteLLM (`pip install --upgrade litellm`).
4. **Streaming**: For streaming responses, you'd need to modify the code to use `litellm.completion(..., stream=True)`.

Save the code as `cli-app.py`, make it executable (`chmod +x cli-app.py` on Linux/Mac), and you're ready to use it!
